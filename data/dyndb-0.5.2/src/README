dyndb is a database library allowing for multiple readers and a single 
writer at any time. The functions are quite fast for up to about 70000 
records. Performance is likely to degrade after that point. See 
    http://www.ohse.de/uwe/software/dyndb/dyndb.html 
for more information.

dyndb comes with NO warranty.


How to compile the library and tools:

  $ make

  You might want to change the compiler settings:

  $ make CC=lcc CFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=-g

  By default gcc is assumed.


How to test:

  $ make check


How to report success: (not mandatory)

  $ make REALNAME="My Name" systype 
  $ make REALNAME="My Name" systype  |mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de
  do not send any email unless "make check" was successful, please.


How to install the tools:

  "make install" installs them into /usr/local/bin, and makes "root" the
  owner of all files.

  If you want to change this location to /home/me/bin use:
    "make nochown=true prefix=/home/me install"


How to use the database library:

  Simply copy the files you need to whereever you need them and
  include them into your Makefile. You may want to copy some or
  all of:
    dyndb_seek.c dyndb_hash.c dyndb_read.c dyndb_fdisk.c dyndb_walk.c 
	dyndb_create.c dyndb_write.c dyndb_enter.c dyndb_tdisk.c
  and dyndb.h.

  The functions need a 32bit unsigned integer type. For some reason that
  type is called uo_uint32_t (uint32 collides with some libraries, uint32_t
  also). The easiest way to adapt the functions to your environment is
  to provide your own "typesize.h". 

  Some functions also need "ssize_t". You need to get a definition of 
  that type (which all modern systems provide in <sys/types.h>) before
  you include "dyndb.h").

  GNU autoconf may be helpful to you (but is not needed).
