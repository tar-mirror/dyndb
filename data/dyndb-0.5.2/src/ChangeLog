version:  0.5.2
bugfix:   dyndb_fwalk might crash due to access beyond the bounds
          of an mmap()ed area. No security impact. Workaround: use
		  dyndb_walk().

version:  0.5.1
internal: fixed a number of installation / build problems.
internal: proofread the library, fixed a number of minor issues.
internal: dyndb_fwalk failed on linux due to mmap implementation
          differences (linux wants a strict alignment). Old bug,
		  didn't surface in older version since older versions
		  did a fallback to dyndb_walk if mmap failed.
