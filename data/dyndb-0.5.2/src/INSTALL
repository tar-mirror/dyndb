How to install dyndb
       This document describes how to download, compile, test and
       install dyndb.


   System requirements:
       The  dyndb  package  is	meant  to  run	under  UNIX   and
       -lookalikes.



   Create a /package directory:
	 $ mkdir /package
	 $ chmod 1755 /package
	 $ cd /package
       You  may	 use  another  directory. No program in the dyndb
       package	cares  where  it  is   installed.   /package   is
       recommended.

       The latest published dyndb package is:

       http://www.ohse.de/uwe/dyndb/dyndb-0.5.1.tar.gz

       You can alternatively download it through FTP:

       ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/dyndb/dyndb-0.5.1.tar.gz



   Unpack the package:
	 $ gunzip dyndb-0.5.1.tar.gz
	 $ tar -xpf dyndb-0.5.1.tar # note the 'p'
	 $ rm dyndb-0.5.1.tar
	 $ cd data/dyndb-0.5.1


   Compile and install the programs:
	 $ package/install


   Where commands and documentation are installed:
       By    default	the    binaries	   are	  installed    in
       /package/dyndb-0.5.1/commmand.  (replace /package/ by  the
       directory  where	 you  you unpacked the dyndb distribution
       in).  Symbolic  links  to  the  commands	 are  created  in
       /command/    and,    for	   compatibility    reasons,   in
       /usr/local/bin.
       Manual pages are	 installed  in	/package/dyndb-0.5.1/doc.
       Symbolic	 links	to  the	 manual	 pages	are created under
       /usr/local/man.

       If you don't like this then:
	 $ package/compile && package/check
	 $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
	 $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc



   Self check:
       compile/install	(or  compile/check)  try  to   run   some
       automated tests. If these tests fail the software will not
       be installed.

       The tests take some time. Things are fine if they  do  not
       print anything.


   How to report success: (not mandatory)
	 $ mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de <compile/systype

       Please  do  not	send this email if the self-check failed.
       Send an problem report to the mailing list instead.



   Cleaning up:
       If you are short on disk space you may remove the  compile
       and src directories:
	 $ rm -rf compile src



   Mailing list:
       To  subscribe  to  the  dyndb  mailing list send a mail to
       dyndb-subscribe@lists.ohse.de. The content is ignored.

       You do not need to subscribe to the mailing list, it is an
       open  one.   But,  if you are not subscribe, make sure you
       mention this in the mail.

       Please include the dyndb	 version  number,  the	operating
       system  and  it's version and any possible relevant output
       of the failing program.	Please include compile/systype in
       your posting.

       If your system is a GNU/Linux one then please include name
       and version  of	your  distribution  and	 your  C  library
       version number (as printed by ldd --version).
