.section "How to install dyndb"
.paragraph
This document describes how to download, compile, test and install dyndb.
.LINE
.subsection "System requirements:"
The dyndb package is meant to run under UNIX and -lookalikes.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Create a /package directory:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ mkdir /package
  $ chmod 1755 /package
  $ cd /package
.HTML </pre>
.fi
You may use another directory. No program in the dyndb package cares
where it is installed. /package is recommended.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subscection "Download dyndb:"
The latest published dyndb package is:
.paragraph
.extlink http://www.ohse.de/uwe/\*(PA/\*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz
.paragraph
You can alternatively download it through FTP:
.paragraph
.extlink ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/\*(PA/\*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Unpack the package:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ gunzip \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz 
  $ tar -xpf \*(PA-\*(VE.tar # note the 'p'
  $ rm \*(PA-\*(VE.tar
  $ cd \*(CL/\*(PA-\*(VE
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.LINE
.subsection "Compile and install the programs:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/install
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.subsection "Where commands and documentation are installed:"
By default the binaries are installed in \fB/package/\*(PA-\*(VE/commmand\fR.
(replace /package/ by the directory where you you unpacked the dyndb 
distribution in). Symbolic links to the commands are created in 
\fB/command/\fR and, for compatibility reasons, in \fB/usr/local/bin\fR.
.br
Manual pages are installed in \fB/package/\*(PA-\*(VE/doc\fR. Symbolic
links to the manual pages are created under \fB/usr/local/man\fR.
.paragraph
If you don't like this then:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/compile && package/check
  $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
  $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
.subsection "Self check:"
\fBcompile/install\fR (or \fBcompile/check\fR) try to run some automated 
tests. If these tests fail the software will not be installed.
.paragraph
The tests take some time. Things are fine if they do not print anything.
.LINE
.subsection "How to report success: (not mandatory)"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de <compile/systype
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
Please do not send this email if the self-check failed. Send an
problem report to the mailing list instead.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Cleaning up:"
If you are short on disk space you may remove the compile and src 
directories:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ rm -rf compile src
.HTML </pre>
.fi
