.section NAME
dyndb - a dynamical database
.section DESCRIPTION
A dyndb is database with 1 key <-> 1 value relation.
The dyndb package contains fast and reliable tools to create, change and 
read that database. It also contains the library functions used by that
programs.
.section COPYRIGHT
The tools are published under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
The library functions are published under the GNU Lesser General Public
License.
.paragraph
Some auxiliary source files have been published under different libraries.
None of them affect the library functions. 
.paragraph
The file \fILICENSES\fR in the source distribution contains a listing
of the licenses.
.section CAVEATS
The dyndb database has a number of limitation:
.paragraph
.list 
.listentry
There may only be one process writing to any database file at a given
time (although many other processes may read during that time).
An application may use file locking to get around that limitation.
.listentry
The database size is limited to 31 bits (2gigabytes).
.listentry
Keys and data are limited to 31 bits also.
.listentry
Hash, key length, data length and pointers are stored in little
endian byte order.
.listentry
Although it's possible to delete elements there is not way
to reclaim the disk space of the records: deleted data is
unavailable, not freed.
.listentry
The default table layout is targetted to offer nice performance
for about 50000 to 100000 elements (note that your systems seek
and read performance might limit the performance even more).
Above that the performance will degrade drastically.
.listentry
Keys do not need to be unique. The library functions deal with
this, but the tools do not provide a way to return more than one record.
.listentry
The order of the records is not preserved.
