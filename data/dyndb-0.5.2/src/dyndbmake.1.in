.section NAME
dyndbmake - create a dynamic database
.br
dyndbdump - dump a dynamic database
.br
dyndbfdump - faster dump of a dynamic database
.section SYNOPSIS
dyndbmake \fIdbfile\fR \fItmpfile\fR <input
.br
dyndbdump \fI[-n]\fR \fI<dbfile\fR
.br
dyndbfdump \fI[-n]\fR \fI<dbfile\fR

.section Desciption

.subsection dyndbmake

\fBdyndbmake\fR creates a temporary database file \fItmpfile\fR, reads a
series of encoded records from its standard input and appends them
to \fItmpfile\fR. As soon as it runs out of input it will move \fItmpfile\fR
to \fIdbfile\fR, deleting any former file in that place.
.paragraph
\fItmpfile\fR is destroyed if it already exists.
.br
\fBdyndbmake\fR makes sure that \fItmpfile\fR is safely written to disk 
before it replaces \fIdbfile\fR in an atomical operation.
The directories containing the files must be writable to dyndbmake.
Both must also be on the same filesystem.
.paragraph
If the input is in a bad format or if dyndbmake has any trouble
writing \fItmpfile\fR to disk, dyndbmake complains and leaves \fIdbfile\fR
alone.

.subsection dyndbdump
\fBdyndbdump\fR reads a database from its standard input and prints
the database contents, in the format described below, on standard output.
If the \fI-n\fR option is used then no final newline will be written.
.paragraph
\fBdyndbdump\fR may be used while other processes add new information to
\fIdbfile\fR. It may dump records more than once in that case.

.subsection dyndbfdump
\fBdyndbfdump\fR is like dyndbdump, but faster. It must not be used while
other processes write to \fIdbfile\fR.

.section "Record format"
dyndbmake expects records in the following format:
.paragraph
  +\fBklen\fR,\fBdlen\fR:\fBkey\fR->\fBdata\fR
.paragraph
Note the "plus" character.
.br
\fBklen\fR is the length of the key, measured in bytes. \fBdlen\fR is the
length of the data, again measured in bytes. \fBkey\fR is the key, and
\fBdata\fR is the data. The end of the record is indicated by a
newline character.
.paragraph
An extra newline character terminates the data.
.paragraph
.nf
.HTML <pre>
Example:

  line1: +1,2:a->ab
  line2: +3,4:abc->abcd
  line3:
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
dyndbmake allows for many records with the same key, but the reading
functions need to support that (my ones only read on record from the
database).
.paragraph
dyndbmake, dyndbdump and dyndbfdump do not preserve the order of records.
